LackPaint.py is an inksnek Python program to create an SVG for laser-cutting a simple facade which clamps over the LCD+Uno combination.
See https://github.com/funnypolynomial/inksnek
LackPaint.svg is the SVG, ready for cutting (blue = cut)
LackPaint.png is a DEVEL image of the facade pieces, with thicker lines (orange is construction linework)
